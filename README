# Auth0 Demo with MCP-GO ðŸš€

A simple demo showing how to integrate Auth0 authentication with MCP-GO. This tool lets you manage authentication state and access protected data through a command-line interface.

## Quick Start

1. Set up your Auth0 credentials in `main.go`:
   - `auth0Domain`
   - `auth0ClientID` 
   - `auth0ClientSecret`
   - `auth0Audience` (optional)

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Available commands:
   - `login` - Start Auth0 authentication flow
   - `get_token` - View your current access token
   - `get_data` - Retrieve stored data
   - `logout` - End your session

## How it Works

The app runs both an MCP server for CLI interactions and a local HTTP server (port 8080) to handle Auth0 callbacks. When you log in, it'll open your browser for Auth0 authentication and store your tokens securely in memory.
